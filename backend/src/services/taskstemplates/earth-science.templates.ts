What early warning systems exist?\n4. How can infrastructure be designed for resilience?\n5. What role does climate change play?\n6. How do you prioritize mitigation efforts?\n\nAnswer: Hurricane risk increases with warm ocean temperatures, low pressure. Earthquake risk assessed by fault proximity, soil type, building codes. Early warning systems include seismic networks, weather monitoring. Resilient design includes flood barriers, earthquake-resistant construction. Climate change intensifies storms and sea level rise. Prioritize by probability × impact × cost-effectiveness."
