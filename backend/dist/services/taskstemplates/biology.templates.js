Explain how the lac operon works in the presence of lactose but absence of glucose\n2. What happens when both lactose and glucose are present?\n3. How does cAMP-CAP complex affect transcription?\n4. Draw a diagram showing the regulation\n\nAnswer: In presence of lactose (no glucose), lactose binds repressor, cAMP-CAP complex binds promoter, transcription occurs. With both present, glucose reduces cAMP, less CAP binding, reduced transcription."

Explain the adaptive immune response (4+ hours)\n3. How do memory cells provide long-term protection?\n4. Why might this patient be susceptible to a different influenza strain?\n5. What role do cytokines play in the immune response?\n\nAnswer: Innate response includes physical barriers, NK cells, complement system. Adaptive response involves B-cells (antibodies) and T-cells (cell-mediated). Memory cells provide rapid response to re-infection. Different strains have different antigens, requiring new immune response. Cytokines coordinate immune cell communication and response."

What are the two main repair mechanisms?\n4. How would you verify successful editing?\n5. What are potential off-target effects and how to minimize them?\n\nAnswer: Guide RNA targets specific DNA sequence. Cas9 creates DSBs at target site. NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) or HDR (homology-directed repair) repair the break. Verification by sequencing, PCR, or functional assays. Off-target effects minimized by careful guide design and using high-fidelity Cas9 variants."
